<p class="heading">Final Project</p>

<p class ="text">
<b>Overview.</b> 
In the final project, you must analyze the <b> role of incentives and strategic
behavior</b> in a particular <b> system or class of algorithms</b>.   The domain you choose can be similar to ones we studied in class,  for example:
<ul>
<li> Markets with money:  Auctions, Decentralized matching markets, etc</li>
<li> Markets without money:  school choice, kidney exchange, two-sided matching,
voting, fair division, etc.</li>
<li> Game theory: Problems that can modeled as a normal or extensive-form game.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="text">
<b> Learning Goals</b>
There are several learning goals of the final project:
<ul>  
<li>  To dig deeper in one of the areas of algorithmic game theory.</li>
<li>  To read and understand recent research papers in the field.</li>
<li>  To apply the framework and concepts developed in class to a new regime.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p class="text">
<b> Choosing a Topic.</b>
As you choosing a project topic, keep the following in mind:

<ul>  
<li>  Pick a topic you will enjoy working on (something fun!)</li>
<li>  Pick a topic that you will learn a lot from (something useful!)</li>
<li>  Pick a topic that is relevant to the course (something relevant!)</li>
<li>  Pick a topic with the scope in mind (~3 weeks)</li>
<li>  Pick a topic that is technical interesting:  relevant
research is published in CS/Econ conferences.</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p class ="text">
<b>Theory vs Implementation.</b>
Your project may be purely implementation or purely theoretical (or anywhere in between).  If you are choosing
an implementation project, keep in mind:

<ul>  
<li>  Scope and effort should match the timeline (3x a regular assignment) </li>
<li>  Even when implementing an algorithm, it is important to understand the theoretical foundations 
behind the work and put the implementation in context with the theory in your write up.</li>
</ul>

<p class ="text">
If you choose to work on a purely theoretical topic, keep in mind that you are
expected to go above and beyond summarizing existing results. You do not need to solve an open problem to do this,  your contribution can take many forms: 
  <ul>
  <li> Really understanding the literature in a way that you can recreate the results</li>
  <li>
Filling in details and providing context and examples that the papers may have overlooked</li>

  <li> Finding something new to say about the existence work</li>
  <li>  Identifying interesting directions to take the literature forward (even if there is not enough time to pursue them)</li>
  </ul>

<p class ="text">
It is important to note that purely theoretical projects can often be more challenging and open-ended, with a final product that may feel less tangible.   As a result, most projects in the past were somewhere in the middle:  understanding the theory behind a market or algorithms and evaluating its properties through a series of simulations.

<b>Project Timeline and Rubric.</b>  
Details will be posted towards the end of the course.

<p class="heading">Topics and Research Papers</p>
<p class ="text">
The following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NiTaNXep5J6Cf3RguC3__N8luAgq_73QZw86tDMBq2Y/edit?usp=sharing">document</a> provides examples of projects you may pursue. The
first idea (Incentives in BitTorrent) is more structured and intended to serve a default option that you
may pursue or use as an example for your own custom project.
